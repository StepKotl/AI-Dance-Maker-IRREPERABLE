The best way to approach something like this is to have a pre-defined set of dances that a character can perform, then one of those options is selected by the ai using a selected section of the music file and ensured that it moves smoothly between the animations.
After that, we take whatever output we get and throw it into godot, with timings depending on what it is that we're doing. 

Look more into the ASIT++ Database of dances and take them for use

Instead of having to look for specific databases, take clips of longer dances, and just pair it as closely to the inputted audio to make a dance.
